This is a simple Project build using HTML,CSS and
JavaScrtipt. Which is basic Typing practice web app, where
any one who is new to typing or who wants to improve
their typing skill can use this Web app to increase their
Skill. where in JavaScript I use "Date.now" method which
calculates the total time taken to done the task.
User has to "START" the task by clicking the START
button.
Once the task starts user will get a Quote, which is
randomly chosen among the Quotes which is already
given as input in "script.js" file.
Next Printing Word will be Highlights with Yellow
colour.
In case if user printing the word other than or
something else than it has been highlighted, then then
that is Highlighted with red color.
At the end The total time taken to Complete the task
will displayed.
Using Netlify I hosted the site.
